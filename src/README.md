# ⚔️ Ancient Coding Warriors

**A combat-based educational programming game that teaches logic and fundamentals through handcrafted challenges.**

---

## 🎮 Game Overview

Ancient Coding Warriors is an educational game where you learn programming by battling through 40 handcrafted levels. Each level tests your understanding of programming concepts—NOT your ability to type syntax from memory.

### Key Features

✅ **6 Warrior Classes** - Each representing a programming language with unique philosophy  
✅ **40 Static Levels** - Handcrafted challenges across 4 chapters  
✅ **Logic-Focused Gameplay** - Test understanding, not memorization  
✅ **Comprehensive Arsenal** - In-depth learning library with 8+ categories  
✅ **Time-Based Damage** - Strategic depth through timed execution  
✅ **No AI Backend** - Pure static content, no procedural generation

## 🗡️ Warrior Classes

Choose your path through one of six warrior archetypes:

| Warrior | Language | Philosophy | Symbolism |
|---------|----------|------------|-----------|
| **Serpent Sage** | Python | Simple is better than complex | Serpents shed skin to evolve |
| **Iron Guardian** | Java | Structure brings strength | Iron armor forged through discipline |
| **Trickster Rogue** | JavaScript | Adaptability is survival | Lightning strikes everywhere |
| **Primitive Bladesmith** | C | Power through precision | The forge shapes raw metal |
| **Arcane Warlock** | C++ | Complexity serves power | Arcane circles within circles |
| **Elegant Duelist** | Ruby | Beauty in simplicity | Polished gems reflect light |

## 📚 Chapter Structure

### Chapter 1: The Awakening (Levels 1-10)
Learn **basic syntax fundamentals**: operators, keywords, and Python basics.

### Chapter 2: The Branching Path (Levels 11-20)
Master **comparison and equality operators** plus conditional keywords.

### Chapter 3: The Return (Levels 21-30)
Understand **function syntax** and advanced operators.

### Chapter 4: The Composition (Levels 31-40)
Learn **advanced syntax** including loops, built-ins, and lambda.

## ⚔️ Combat Mechanics

### Damage System (Time-Based Tiers)

Your damage depends on **when** you complete challenges:

| Time Remaining | Damage Multiplier | Tier Name |
|----------------|-------------------|-----------|
| **>30 seconds** | 3x (MAX) | ⭐ Quick Strike |
| **10-30 seconds** | 1.5x | ⚔️ Moderate |
| **3-9 seconds** | 0.8x | 💢 Low |
| **0-2 seconds** | 3x (MAX) | 🔥 **Adrenaline Surge** |

**Adrenaline Surge Bonus**: In Chapter 4+ (levels 31-40), clutch victories grant +10 seconds!

### Enemy Health Scaling

- **Early Game (1-3)**: 150-180 HP (very forgiving)
- **Mid Game (4-20)**: 250-1200 HP (requires multiple hits)
- **Late Game (21-40)**: 1300-5000 HP (demands mastery)

**Boss Levels** (10, 20, 30, 40) have significantly more health than regular levels.

## 🎓 The Arsenal

When you fall in battle, you're sent to **The Arsenal**—a vast library of programming knowledge.

### 10 Learning Categories

1. **Foundations of Code** - What is programming? Syntax basics.
2. **Variables & Data Storage** - Storing and using values.
3. **Data Types** - Integers, strings, booleans, floats.
4. **Operators** - Arithmetic, comparison, logical operators.
5. **Conditional Logic** - If/else, elif, nested conditions.
6. **Loops & Iteration** - For loops, while loops, patterns.
7. **Functions** - Parameters, return values, scope.
8. **Logic Patterns** - Guards, flags, accumulators.
9. **Problem-Solving** - Reading problems, debugging.
10. **Best Practices** - DRY, naming, code organization.

Each category contains multiple lessons with:
- Clear explanations
- Code examples
- Conceptual insights
- Warrior-specific wisdom

## 🎯 What Makes This Game Different?

### ❌ What You DON'T Do:
- Type full strings or messages
- Write complete functions
- Memorize syntax
- Deal with compilation errors

### ✅ What You DO Do:
- Complete logical expressions
- Choose correct operators
- Evaluate conditions
- Trace function execution
- **Think about HOW code works**

### Example Challenge:
```python
# You see this:
if power ___ 50:
    cast_spell()

# You type: >
# (Understanding that "greater than" is the correct comparison)
```

## 🔥 Unique Mechanics

### The 10-Second Hint
When the timer hits exactly 10 seconds, your warrior whispers a subtle hint. Never a direct answer—just a conceptual nudge or analogy tied to your warrior's philosophy.

### Warrior-Themed Feedback
Each warrior class has unique dialogue and philosophical reflections during battles and in the Arsenal.

### Chapter Boss Battles
Every 10th level is a boss fight with significantly higher HP, requiring multiple correct executions and strategic damage timing.

## 🎯 Design Philosophy

> "Learning to code shouldn't feel like memorizing syntax.  
> It should feel like solving puzzles with logic and understanding."

This game teaches **concepts**, not syntax. Skills learned here translate to **any programming language**.
